# Dashboard Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the QSAR modeling dashboard to include the newly fixed Morgan model results for the 3 previously failed proteins.

## Updated Results

### **CYP2B6 (P20813) - Human**

- **Classification F1**: 0.000 (0 active compounds)

### **CYP2C19 (P33261) - Human**
- **Status**: ✅ Completed  
- **Samples**: 165
- **Regression R²**: 0.351
- **Regression RMSE**: 0.573
- **Classification Accuracy**: 0.982
- **Classification F1**: 0.000 (3 active compounds)
- **Classification AUC**: 0.907

### **SLCO2B1 (O94956) - Human**
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Samples**: 33
- **Regression R²**: -0.266
- **Regression RMSE**: 0.704
- **Classification Accuracy**: 1.000
- **Classification F1**: 0.000 (0 active compounds)

## Files Updated
- `analyses/standardized_qsar_models/modeling_summary.csv` - Updated with new Morgan model results
- `analyses/standardized_qsar_models/esm_morgan_modeling_summary.csv` - Updated with placeholder entries for ESM+Morgan models

## Dashboard Impact
The dashboard will now show:
- **3 additional completed Morgan models** (total: 47 completed Morgan models)
- **Updated protein counts** in the Summary Statistics section
- **New data points** in all relevant plots and visualizations
- **Updated model performance metrics** across all sections

## Next Steps
1. **ESM+Morgan Models**: Run `python rerun_failed_proteins.py` in the `esmc` conda environment to generate ESM+Morgan models
2. **Dashboard Refresh**: The dashboard will automatically pick up the new results when refreshed
3. **Verification**: Check the dashboard to confirm all new results are displayed correctly

## Technical Notes
- Old error entries were removed and replaced with successful results
- ESM+Morgan summary includes placeholder entries with status "pending_esm"
- All model metrics are properly formatted and compatible with existing dashboard code
- No changes were made to the dashboard code itself - only data files were updated
