# MCC Analysis Dashboard Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) analysis results into the QSAR Modeling Dashboard. The MCC analysis compares regression vs classification models using MCC as the primary metric.

## What Was Added

### 1. Navigation Structure
- Added "MCC Analysis" section under "Performance Metrics" category
- Accessible via: Performance Metrics > MCC Analysis

### 2. Data Loading Functions
- `load_mcc_analysis_data()`: Loads summary and detailed comparison data
- `load_mcc_plots()`: Loads MCC analysis visualization files

### 3. Visualization Functions
- `create_mcc_summary_metrics()`: Displays key metrics and win rates
- `create_mcc_win_rate_chart()`: Interactive bar chart comparing model approaches
- `create_mcc_difference_analysis()`: Histogram distributions of MCC differences
- `create_mcc_scatter_plot()`: Scatter plots comparing regression vs classification MCC
- `create_mcc_detailed_table()`: Detailed results table with all comparisons

### 4. Dashboard Page Features
- **Summary Metrics**: Key statistics for both Morgan and ESM+Morgan models
- **Win Rate Comparison**: Visual comparison of which approach performs better
- **MCC Difference Analysis**: Distribution analysis of performance differences
- **Scatter Plot Comparison**: Direct comparison of regression vs classification MCC scores
- **Detailed Results Table**: Complete comparison results for all protein-organism combinations
- **Static Visualizations**: Integration of generated plot files
- **Key Findings & Recommendations**: Clear conclusions and recommendations

## Key Results Displayed

### Morgan Models
- **44 total comparisons**
- **Classification wins: 29 (65.9%)**
- **Mean MCC improvement: +0.0343**

### ESM+Morgan Models
- **44 total comparisons**
- **Classification wins: 24 (54.5%)**
- **Mean MCC improvement: +0.0236**

## Recommendations Shown
- **Morgan Models**: Use Classification models (65.9% win rate)
- **ESM+Morgan Models**: Use Classification models (54.5% win rate)
- Clear evidence that classification models generally outperform regression models

## Files Modified
- `qsar_modeling_dashboard.py`: Added MCC analysis integration
- All MCC analysis data and plots are loaded from `analyses/mcc_comparison/`

## How to Access
1. Run the dashboard: `streamlit run qsar_modeling_dashboard.py`
2. Navigate to: Performance Metrics > MCC Analysis
3. View comprehensive MCC analysis results and visualizations

## Data Sources
- Summary data: `analyses/mcc_comparison/results/mcc_analysis_summary.csv`
- Detailed results: `analyses/mcc_comparison/results/morgan_comparison_detailed.csv`
- Detailed results: `analyses/mcc_comparison/results/esm_morgan_comparison_detailed.csv`
- Visualizations: `analyses/mcc_comparison/plots/`

The integration provides a comprehensive view of the MCC analysis results directly within the existing QSAR modeling dashboard, making it easy to compare regression vs classification model performance across all protein-organism combinations.
